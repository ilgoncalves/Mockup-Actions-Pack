# Mockups Actions Pack

This repo contains all the latest actions (.atn) used by the mockups published on originalmockups.com. Follow these steps in order to customize the mockups using the actions

## How to use the mockups with actions

Currently to speed up the customization process of the mockups we recommend you the use of **Photoshop Actions**, please follow these steps in order to edit the mockups using Actions:

1. Download the **[Latest Actions Pack](https://github.com/originalmockups/Mockups-Actions-Pack/releases/latest)**
2. Install the actions by double clicking to the **Mockups Action Pack.atn** file
3. Open the Mockup in Photoshop
4. Place your own design into the *Blue Layers*, they are *Smart Objects* so you can edit its contents doing *Right Click / Edit Contents*.
5. Hide the *Guide* layer, Save, close the current document and continue with the next *Blue Layer* if there are more ones.
6. Open the Actions Panel (Window / Actions) and play the related action which is described on the README file or inside the Mockup PSD file.
 
## I don't want to use the actions

We recommend the use of Actions, but you still can continue using the traditional method without Actions, go to the *Resource / Mockups* layer set and edit the contents of the *Purple Layers*. It'll be opened in a new window (tab) allowing you to place your own design without use Actions.

## Optional Visual Effects

If you want to play with visual effects like shadows, shines, opacity, textures and another extra layers, just go to the *Yellow Layers* and make your own customization.

I hope these instructions has been helpful

## Troubleshooting

### Handling the error: The command “Select” is not currently available running the Actions

This error happens when Photoshop arbitrarily rename the Smart Objects causing the loss of the link between the Mockup file and the Actions. It is due to the Photoshop temporary directory is full. So easiest way to fix this is closing Photoshop without save the Mockup in order to free up that directory.

If you accidentally saved the changes with the bad names, you can fix it manually deleting the number added at the end of the layer arbitrarily by Photoshop and then run de action again.
